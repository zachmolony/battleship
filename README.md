# AdaShip - Battleship game in C++

## Problem Summary and Solution

Adaship is a command-line game based on the traditional board game battleship. Players take turns trying to destroy each other's battleships placed along a grid. This means that boards will have to hold data relating to placed boats, fired shots and missed shots. The player also needs to be able to take torpedo shots, and receive information on the result of the shot (hit/miss).

A CPU player needs to be created using an auto-placing feature. The boards will also need to be displayed to the user containing the placed ships and hits/misses. The game also needs to prevent invalid input but also invalid auto placing & manual placements.

#### Further considerations include:

- Loading setup configurations from a text file
- Salvo game mode (player can take as many shots as they have remaining boats)
- Combinations of human and CPU players.
- Unlimited boats in setup
- Hidden mines game mode (five mines are in random locations, and cause wider explosions on hits)
- Algorithm to improve the AI of the CPU
